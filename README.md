##Course Description
This GitHub repository serves as class notes and contains code from almost every concept taught in the CS 300: Advanced Programming course by Dr. Waqar Ahmed at SBASSE LUMS.

CS 300 is an advanced programming course that teaches students how to write efficient, maintainable, and reusable code. The course covers a wide range of topics including programming paradigms, object-oriented programming, design patterns, and software engineering. The course also covers advanced topics such as concurrency, parallelism, and distributed computing. The course will initially focus on Haskell, a purely functional programming language, and will then move on to cover imperative programming languages with Typescript and the MERN stack.
