# Week 1: Introduction to Programming Paradigms
###### Advanced Programming will go over the concepts of programming paradigms, with indepth Typescript MERN Stack
###### Course Breakdown already provided in the README file

### What are Programming Paradigms?
- Programming Paradigms are the different ways of thinking about programming
    - Imperative: How
    - Declarative: What
    - Functional: How
    - Object Oriented: How
    - Procedural: How
    - Logic: How

**A programming language and a paradigm, are two different things**

Our main focus will be on Functional Programming for the first 4 weeks
In functional programming, we think more about what we want to do, rather than how to do it

Functional Programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data


#### Concepts of Functional Programming:
- **State**: The current value of a variable
- **Side Effects:** Any change of state or observable interaction with the outside world that occurs during the calculation of a result
- **Types of functions in functional programming:**
    - **Pure Functions**: A function that, given the same arguments, will always return the same result and does not cause any observable side effects
    - **First Class Functions**: Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed as an argument to other functions, returned as values from other functions
    - **Higher Order Functions:** A function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function
    - **Anonymous Functions**: Functions that do not have a name
- **Immutability**: Unchanging over time or unable to be changed
- **Recursion**: A function that calls itself
- **Currying**: The process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument
- **Composition**: The process of putting two functions together to form a third function where the output of one function is the input of the other
- **Point Free Style:** A style of programming where the data is the focus, rather than the functions
- **Referential Transparency:** An expression is referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior
